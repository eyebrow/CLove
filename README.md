CLove
=====
CLove is a simple, easy to learn and use 2D/3D game framework tested on
Mac/Linux/PC, made in C with OpenGLES 2 which uses Lua as scripting langauge.

How to build
============
On Windows: 
- Download and install mingw and let the setup configure the path for you. 
 Open up the CMD and type gcc if you get an error then type this: setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\MinGW\bin;" . That command will add 
 the bin folder to the path.
 After that check if you got gcc & g++ installed.
- Download and install CMake and let the setup configure the path for you.
- Make a new directory called build inside CLove and call: 
 cmake ../ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER:PATH=C:/MinGW/bin/gcc.exe -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:PATH=C:/MinGW/bin/g++.exe . If this command 
 does not work then go in C:\Program Files\CMake\bin and open up cmake-gui.exe. Tell it where is Clove and where you want to build the   project. Also do not forget to use custom compiler that is set to GCC as C compiler and G++ as the C++ compiler. 
 After that use the make command and that's it( if you get errors that make does not exist then paste this into CMD terminal: 
  copy c:\MinGW\bin\mingw32-make.exe c:\MinGW\bin\make.exe )
- Download DX SDK 2010 only if you get errors from SDL when building: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812
- After you have succesfuly build CLove go into src/3rdparty directory and copy: SDL2, openal and physfs .dll in the same directory where clove.exe is.
- Restart the PC if needed

On Linux & OS X:
- Download and install cmake,gcc,g++(optional git)(on os x you can install these using brew)
- Download and install QT Community 
- If you got problems with building on Linux(Debian based) install these: 
sudo apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev libglew1.5 libglew1.5-dev 
libglu1-mesa libglu1-mesa-dev libgl1-mesa-glx libgl1-mesa-dev libasound2-dev 
libaudio-dev libesd0-dev libpulse-dev libroar-dev

Contributing
========
If you want to contribute to the project, feel free to work on what you please. I want to do a lot of the other stuff myself too.
Please try to replicate the code style of the existing code by using QT Community, I might refuse to pull your changes otherwise.

Examples (see examples folder)
--------
```lua
local image = love.graphics.newImage("image.png")

function love.draw()
   --draw the loaded image named "image" at the postion X:200, Y:200
	love.graphics.draw(image, 200, 200)
	--draw a circle at X:100 Y:100 with the radius of 32 and number of
	--segments(points) of 24
	love.graphics.circle("fill", 100, 100, 32, 24)
end
```
